This is a custom Windows Sandbox configuration file which deploys the sandbox environment and installs [qBittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) at logon.

Updated versions of the installer need to be manually updated in Install-qBittorrent.ps1 using the $uri variable

The configuration can be launched by running SandboxInstall-qBittorrent.wsb
